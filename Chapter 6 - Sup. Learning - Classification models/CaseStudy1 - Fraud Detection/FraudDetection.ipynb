    "## 6.2. Model Tuning for balancing the sample by Random Under Sampling\n",
    "In this phase of the project we will implement \"Random Under Sampling\" which basically consists of removing data in order to have a more balanced dataset and thus avoiding our models to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. The first thing we have to do is determine how imbalanced is our class (use \"value_counts()\" on the class column to determine the amount for each label)\n",
    "2. Once we determine how many instances are considered fraud transactions (Fraud = \"1\") , we should bring the non-fraud transactions to the same amount as fraud transactions (assuming we want a 50/50 ratio), this will be equivalent to 492 cases of fraud and 492 cases of non-fraud transactions.\n",
    "3. After implementing this technique, we have a sub-sample of our dataframe with a 50/50 ratio with regards to our classes. Then the next step we will implement is to shuffle the data to see if our models can maintain a certain accuracy everytime we run this script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The main issue with \"Random Under-Sampling\" is that we run the risk that our classification models will not perform as accurate as we would like to since there is a great deal of information loss (bringing 492 non-fraud transaction from 284,315 non-fraud transaction)\n"
